# QA Testing Lab

Welcome to the "Will Jira talk to GitHub?" experiment.  
This repository is our testing ground for making sure Jira and GitHub work together as expected.

## Purpose
To verify that commits, branches, and pull requests in GitHub are correctly linked to Jira issues.  
Because smooth integration means fewer headaches and more time for actual work.

## How to test
1. Create a Jira issue â€“ e.g., `EV-1`.
2. Make a branch or commit in this repository, including the Jira issue key in its name or commit message.
3. Push your changes to GitHub.
4. Check Jira to confirm the related commits are displayed.
