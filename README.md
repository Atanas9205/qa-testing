# QA Testing Lab

Welcome to the ultimate **"Will Jira talk to GitHub?"** experiment.  
This is our test playground to make sure Jira and GitHub are best buddies. ü§ù

## Purpose
To verify that commits, branches, and pull requests in GitHub are **properly linked** to Jira issues ‚Äî  
because nothing says "teamwork" like two tools speaking the same language.

## How to test
1. **Create a Jira issue** ‚Äì e.g., `EV-1` (give it a cool title).
2. **Make a branch or commit** in this repository, **including the Jira issue key** in its name/message.
3. **Push** your changes to GitHub.
4. Head over to Jira and admire how your commits magically appear there. ‚ú®
